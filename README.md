#   Project description:
    1) A frontend project using ReactJS.
    2) Implemented a dark mode toggle on landing page located at navigation bar for users to change the colour
       of the landing page to either dark and bright.

#   To run the project:
    On VS code terminal, type npm start

#   Frontend dependencies installed:

#   Conclusion:
